<h2>About this Blog</h2>
<p>The goal of this blog is to host short, informal articles about the
<a href="https://chapel-lang.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chapel parallel programming language</a>.  Over
time, you can expect to see articles teaching language concepts,
describing new features or performance results, sharing user
experiences, reporting on community events, and other Chapel-related
topics.  Our intent is that this will be a space for more in-depth
content than our <a href="https://twitter.com/ChapelLanguage" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChapelLanguage" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Facebook</a> feeds can handle,
and in more of a browse-at-your-own-speed format than our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ChapelParallelProgrammingLanguage" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube
channel</a>.</p>

</h2>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Chapel, it is a general-purpose
programming language that makes parallel programming far more
productive than conventional approaches.  Chapel supports scalable
parallelism, permitting code to be developed using a laptop’s
multi-core processor, and then recompiled to run across the nodes and
cores of a commodity cluster, cloud instance, or massive-scale
supercomputer.  Though Chapel code tends to be reasonably concise and
readable, the resulting performance can compete with or beat standard
high-performance computing (HPC) approaches, such as Fortran/C/C++,
OpenMP, MPI, and/or CUDA.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in learning more about Chapel, stick around and
keep reading!  Alternatively, you can browse <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Chapel
