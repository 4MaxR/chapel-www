Functions for producing program help and usage.

.. note::

 You must declare your ``main`` function to take an array of string arguments
 to use the ``Help`` module. See the examples below or the technical note about
 :ref:`getting arguments from main()<technote-mainWithArgs>` for more
 information on this feature.

Chapel programs can declare main to take arguments like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../test/library/standard/Help/doc-examples/example_read_args.chpl
 :language: chapel
 :start-after: START_EXAMPLE
 :end-before: STOP_EXAMPLE

Programs that use this feature might need to expand upon the usage message
that explains which config variables are available. To do so, this module
includes the :proc:`printUsage` function.


.. function:: proc printUsage()

   
   Print out a usage message for config variables. This function does not
   exit. A typical use of this function would be to call it when ``"--help"``
   or ``"-h"`` are encountered when doing custom argument processing. In
   addition to calling this function, programs with custom argument
   processing should probably also print out a description of the arguments
   that they take.  Once both help messages have been output, the program
   would normally exit early - for example, by returning from main.
   
   A typical example might be this program, that accumulates a list of
   filenames in addition to handling config variable arguments:
   
   .. literalinclude:: ../../../../test/library/standard/Help/doc-examples/example_print_usage.chpl
    :language: chapel
    :start-after: START_EXAMPLE
    :end-before: STOP_EXAMPLE
   
   .. note::
      A Chapel program's executable name (the 0-th argument to main) will
      vary between multilocale and single locale settings.  See
      :ref:`readme-multilocale` for more details.
