   This Dimensional distribution allows the mapping from indices
   to locales to be specified as a composition of independent mappings
   along each dimension. For example, when implementing the HPL
   benchmark, the user may wish to use 2D arrays that are Block-distributed
   along one dimension and replicated along the other dimension.
   Currently only 2D domains and arrays are supported.
   
   Formally, consider a Dimensional distribution with:
   
     ====================  ====================================================
     rank                  ``d``
     dimension specifiers  ``dim_1``, ...., ``dim_d``
     over locales          ``targetLocales: [0..N_1-1, ...., 0..N_d-1] locale``
     ====================  ====================================================
   
   It maps an index ``(i_1, ...., i_d)``
   to the locale ``targetLocales[j_1, ...., j_d]``
   where, for each ``k`` in ``1..d``,
   the mapping is obtained using the dimension specifier:
   
     ``j_k = dim_k(i_k, N_k)``
   
   **Example**
   
   The following code declares a domain ``D`` distributed
   using a 2D Dimensional distribution that
   replicates over 2 locales (when available) in the first dimension
   and distributes using block-cyclic distribution in the second dimension.
   
   .. literalinclude:: ../../../../test/distributions/doc-examples/DimensionalDist2DExamples.chpl
      :language: chapel
      :start-after: START_EXAMPLE
      :end-before: STOP_EXAMPLE
   
   When run on 6 locales, the output is:
   
   .. literalinclude:: ../../../../test/distributions/doc-examples/DimensionalDist2DExamples.good
   
   **Initializer Arguments**
   
   The ``DimensionalDist2D`` class initializer is defined as follows:
   
     .. code-block:: chapel
   
       proc DimensionalDist2D.init(
         targetLocales: [] locale,
         di1,
         di2,
         name: string = "dimensional distribution",
         type idxType = int,
         dataParTasksPerLocale     = // value of  dataParTasksPerLocale      config const,
         dataParIgnoreRunningTasks = // value of  dataParIgnoreRunningTasks  config const,
         dataParMinGranularity     = // value of  dataParMinGranularity      config const )
   
   The argument ``targetLocales`` must be a 2D array indicating
   the locales to distribute over.
   
   The arguments ``di1`` and ``di2`` are the desired dimension specifiers
   for the first and second dimension, respectively.
   
   The ``name`` argument may be useful for debugging.
   It is stored and otherwise ignored by the implementation.
   
   The ``idxType`` argument must match the index type of the domains
   "dmapped" using that DimensionalDist2D instance.
   
   The arguments ``dataParTasksPerLocale``, ``dataParIgnoreRunningTasks``,
   and ``dataParMinGranularity`` set the knobs that are used to
   control intra-locale data parallelism for Block-distributed domains
   and arrays in the same way that the like-named config constants
   control data parallelism for ranges and default-distributed domains
   and arrays.
   
   
   **Dimension Specifiers**
   
   Presently, the following dimension specifiers are available
   (shown here with their initializer arguments):
   
   * :class:`ReplicatedDim(numLocales) <ReplicatedDim>`
   * :class:`BlockDim(numLocales, boundingBox, idxType=boundingBox.idxType) <BlockDim>`
   * :class:`BlockCyclicDim(numLocales, lowIdx, blockSize) <BlockCycDim>`
   
   
   **Limitations**
   
   Only 2D domains and arrays are supported.
   
   There may be performance issues when scaling to a large number of locales.
